When reporting a bug in Marathon, it's helpful if you can also send a pull request containing a failing test case that demonstrates the issue you're reporting. Failing test cases help avoid communication issues, make it trivial for the maintainers to reproduce the issue, and provides some guarantee that the problem won't re-occur in the future.
